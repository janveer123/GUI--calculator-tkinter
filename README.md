# GUI--calculator-tkinter
This is my first GUI project using python. After acquiring knowledge about different GUI frameworks for python, i started with the most used and common framework. firstly i learned the basics of tkinter and started working on this project.

I have used different operators in this program like:-
 1. Button :- The Button widget is used to display the buttons in your application.
 2. Entry :- The Entry widget is used to display a single-line text field for accepting values from a user.
 3. Label :- The Label widget is used to provide a single-line caption for other widgets. It can also contain images.
 4. Text :- The Text widget is used to display text in multiple lines.

Geometry Management:-
  All Tkinter widgets have access to the specific geometry management methods, which have the purpose of organising widgets throughout the parent widget area.I have used the grid() method.
   :-The grid() Method âˆ’ This geometry manager organises widgets in a table-like structure in the parent widget.

Feedback is welcomed.
